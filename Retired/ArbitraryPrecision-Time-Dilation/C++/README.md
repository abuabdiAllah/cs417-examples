# Time Dilation Example Code

This is a set of three example codes: one C++, one quick-and-dirty Python3, and
one cleaned-up Python 3.


## Prerequisites

You either need to have an open SSH session to the CS Department Linux Machines
(e.g., atria.cs.odu.edu) or have a C++ compiler (>= 7.5.0) and Python 3.7+
interpreter.


## Running the Example Code

You can run the code using the provided makefile:

```
make runCpp
```

for the C++ code and

```
make runPython
```

for the revised Python 3 code (i.e., TimeDilationRevised.py).
